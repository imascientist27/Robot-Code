# SWRRobotics Team Practice Repo (49627A)
This repository is dedicated to the development of the Shoreham-Wading River Robotics Team RobotC code.

## Adhering To Gitflow
Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.

**MASTER BRANCH**

The master branch stores the official release history tied to a version. Pull requests can only be accepted by a lead developer.

**DEVELOP BRANCH**

The develop branch serves as an integration branch for features. Individual developer code should be branched from master but always pushed to develop. Branches should follow the naming convention {FirstInitial}{LastName}-{Feature#/name} (Ex. NVERTUCCI-Feature1 or NVERTUCCI-TerminatorBot).
